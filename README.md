# EZ CV

A free and open-source resume builder that simplifies the process of creating, updating, and sharing your resume.

Our work is built upon a fork of [Reactive Resume](https://github.com/AmruthPillai/Reactive-Resume) by [Amruth Pillai](https://www.amruthpillai.com/). Please check out his work.

The project is made in part of an internship at [The Tech Collective EU](https://github.com/thetechcollective) by
[KurisuDaNoda](https://github.com/KurisuDaNoda),
[MagicalGlove](https://github.com/MagicalGlove),
[Mfknudsen](https://github.com/Mfknudsen) and
[SMerved](https://github.com/SMerved).

The bid-manager role aim to allow companies to bid on projects created by other companies using a collection of cvs created by users on our platform.

We also aim to separate the data so that a user can maintain ownership over their own data and so that they decide who can access it and in what manner they can.

With the control of data, we hope to provide an API for integration with already existing systems, so that a user only needs to maintain their cv once and have it reflected on the other platforms they may use.
